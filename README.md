# Wind Tunnel Analyzer
This repository is part of AeroLab Dynamics computational toolkit. The **Wind Tunnel Analyzer** is a lightweight Python utility for performing quick aerodynamic calculations using simplified models and wind tunnel testing concepts. This tool provides estimates of aerodynamic quantities, validation of experimental trends and a simple analytical calculations alongside wind tunnel data. The current version of the tool includes a basic implementation of a linear lift model. However, several analysis features are still under development.

## Experiment

The Wind Tunnel Analyzer is designed to support analysis of aerodynamic data obtained from controlled wind tunnel experiments. This section outlines the relationship between what is physically measured, what is recorded, and what is computed within the tool.

**Inputs (controlled variables)**

During a wind tunnel test, the controlled variables include:

- **Angle of attack** $(\alpha)$
- **Freestream velocity** $(V)$

For the current implementation, the analysis focuses on variations in angle of attack.

**Measurement system**

The wind tunnel setup includes a force balance system used to measure aerodynamic forces acting on the test article. The primary measured quantities are:

- **Lift force** $(L)$ — force perpendicular to the flow
- **Drag force** $(D)$ — force parallel to the flow

These measurements are obtained using load cells.

**Derived quantities**
Lift and drag coefficients can be calculated using:

$$ 
C_L = \frac{L}{\tfrac{1}{2} \rho V^2 A}, \quad  
C_D = \frac{D}{\tfrac{1}{2} \rho V^2 A}  
$$

where:

- $L$ = vertical lift force
- $D$ = horizontal drag force
- $\rho$ = air density
- $V$ = wind velocity
- $A$ = area

These coefficients allow results to be compared across different flow conditions and configurations.

## Analysis

A primary result of wind tunnel testing is the **lift curve**, which relates lift coefficient to angle of attack:

$$  
C_L\ \text{vs}\ \alpha  
$$

This relationship is used to determine operating conditions required to achieve a desired aerodynamic performance.


**Current approach**

In the current workflow, determining the angle of attack required to achieve a target lift coefficient is performed manually.

This involves:

1. performing a sweep over angle of attack during testing
2. plotting the resulting lift curve $(C_L$ vs $\alpha)$
3. estimating the angle of attack corresponding to a desired $C_L$

For simplified models, the relationship can also be evaluated analytically using:

$$  
C_L = C_{L0} + a \alpha  
\quad \longrightarrow \quad  
\alpha = \frac{C_{L,\text{target}} - C_{L0}}{a}  
$$

While effective in simple cases, these approaches rely on manual estimation or algebraic manipulation.

### Automated approach (New feature to be implemented)

To support a more consistent and extensible analysis workflow, the tool is being extended to compute the required angle of attack numerically.

Instead of solving the equation directly, the problem is expressed in residual form:

$$  
f(\alpha) = C_{L0} + a \alpha - C_{L,\text{target}}  
$$

The solution is obtained by finding the value of $\alpha$ such that:

$$  
f(\alpha) = 0  
$$

This approach allows the use of numerical root-finding methods (e.g., `scipy.optimize.fsolve`) and provides a unified framework that can be extended to more complex, nonlinear aerodynamic models.
